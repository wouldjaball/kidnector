## Email Sequences

### Launch Sequence (Week 3-4)

**Email 1: The Problem (Day 15)**
```
Subject: The #1 screen time mistake (that I made too)

Hey {first_name},

For years, I handled screen time the same way:

"Okay, 30 more minutes."
"No, you've had enough."
"I said GET OFF THE IPAD."

Sound familiar?

The mistake? Making myself the gatekeeper.

Every time I said no, I became the bad guy. And my kids learned that screens = something to fight for.

But what if there was another way?

What if kids EARNED their screen time by doing something that actually builds their confidence?

More on that soon. 😉

Talk tomorrow,
[Name]
```

**Email 2: The Tease (Day 17)**
```
Subject: What if screen time wasn't a battle?

{first_name},

Quick question:

What would change if your kids:
- Woke up WANTING to do something positive
- Didn't argue about screen time
- Actually felt proud of themselves every day

One of our beta families told me:

"My son now asks to do his affirmation before breakfast. His streak is 23 days. The iPad arguments? Gone."

That's not magic. That's the system we've been building.

It's called Kidnector.

And it launches Monday.

Keep an eye on your inbox...

**Email 3: The Reveal (Day 19)**
```
Subject: Kidnector launches Monday (here's how it works)

{first_name},

On Monday, we're officially launching Kidnector — the app that turns screen time into a confidence-building tool.

Here's how it works:

1️⃣ Your kid gets a morning notification
2️⃣ They record themselves saying a daily affirmation (30 sec)
3️⃣ You get notified, watch it, and approve
4️⃣ Their screen time unlocks. No arguments. They earned it.

Over time, they build a streak. They get proud of their streak. And you get videos of your kid building self-belief that you'll treasure forever.

Pricing:
$9.99/month (unlimited kids)
$79.99/year (save 33%) ← Launch special

Monday's launch email will have a link to download.

Any questions? Reply and ask.

```

**Email 4: The Countdown (Day 20)**
```
Subject: Tomorrow.

{first_name},

Kidnector goes live tomorrow morning.

If you're tired of:
❌ Arguing about screens every day
❌ Being the "bad guy"
❌ Worrying about what screens are doing to your kid's confidence

Then this is for you.

I'll send the download link at 9am PT.

Talk soon,
